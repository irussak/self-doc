"""Unit tests for `store.classify_sync` — the explicit, directly-testable
status classifier that replaced the implicit `pages_seen`/`succeeded_any`
conditional chain responsible for the 2026-07-26 sync-health incident (see
`test_sync_health.py` for the full incident-shaped regression scenarios and
`store.py`'s module docstring above `SOFT_FAIL_PARTIAL_RATIO` for the root
cause). These tests require no database — `classify_sync` is a pure function
of a `SourceOutcome` plus two booleans.

The table below exercises every branch of `classify_sync`'s documented rule
order, not just the three sync-health incident scenarios:

  1. cancelled by user                              -> failed
  2. nothing indexed or confirmed this run           -> failed
  3. purge_guard_refused                             -> partial
  4. crawl_aborted_early                             -> partial
  5. pages_failed > 0                                -> partial
  6. soft-fail ratio > SOFT_FAIL_PARTIAL_RATIO        -> partial
  7. injection-block ratio > INJECTION_BLOCK_PARTIAL_RATIO -> partial
  8. otherwise                                       -> ok

Rule order also matters: earlier rules must win even when a later rule's
condition also holds (e.g. cancellation must report "failed" even if pages
were fetched, or even if the purge guard also refused).
