"""Tests for app.injection: the indirect-prompt-injection detector.

Two corpora, both load-bearing, for opposite reasons:

  - POSITIVES must reach `injection.load_ruleset().threshold`. These are the
    actual attack shapes this module exists to catch — plain overrides,
    invisible-character evasion (zero-width joiners, soft hyphen, Unicode
    Tags-block "ASCII smuggling"), and hidden-HTML payloads.
  - NEGATIVES must NOT flag. This is the harder, more important half: this
    project's entire purpose is indexing technical documentation, and that
    corpus WILL contain pages that legitimately quote every phrase in the
    positive corpus — OWASP LLM Top 10, LangChain's security page, and every
    HF/Llama/vLLM chat-template doc that shows `<|im_start|>` in a fenced
    code block. A single false positive here means a real page silently
    disappears from the index. Several negatives are written in the actual
    voice of those sources on purpose, not as a synthetic stand-in.

A third corpus (ROUNDTRIP_UNCHANGED) pins that `sanitize_for_storage` is a
byte-identical no-op on legitimate non-Latin orthography — Persian, Hindi,
Nepali, Tamil, and emoji ZWJ sequences all use the same joiner characters
the evasion techniques abuse, and the two must never be confused (see
injection.py's module docstring for the "two views" design this pins).

No database needed anywhere in this file — `injection.py` is a pure module
by design, exactly like `app.security`'s `evaluate_token_policy`.
