"""Integration tests for store.py's hash-diff sync orchestration.

These tests need a live Postgres with the T1 schema applied (the compose
`db` service). They connect using the standard POSTGRES_* env vars and are
skipped automatically if no database is reachable, so `pytest` stays green
in environments without Docker (per-Spoke sandboxes, CI without services).

crawler.crawl / extract.extract are monkeypatched per test so no network
access happens; chunker/embedder run for real (small inputs) to exercise the
full pipeline down to actual `vector` column writes.
