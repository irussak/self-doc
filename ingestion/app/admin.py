"""Server-rendered admin UI for managing `doc_sources` (Jinja2 + vendored HTMX).

Mount point: `router = APIRouter(prefix="/admin")` — a self-contained
`APIRouter` intended to be included by `app.main` (wired in by a sibling
task; this module never imports `app.main` to avoid a circular import).

Routes (see module docstring sections below for detail):

    GET  /admin                        list active + pending sources
    GET  /admin/sources/new            create form
    POST /admin/sources/new            create
    GET  /admin/sources/{id}           edit form
    POST /admin/sources/{id}           update (config + schedule + enabled)
    POST /admin/sources/{id}/delete    delete (cascades pages+chunks)
    POST /admin/sources/{id}/sync      manual sync trigger
    POST /admin/sources/{id}/upload    upload files (source_type='upload' only)
    POST /admin/sources/{id}/approve   pending -> active
    POST /admin/sources/{id}/reject    pending -> rejected
    GET  /admin/quarantine             review queue for flagged (injection-suspected) pages
    POST /admin/quarantine/{id}/allow  index immediately (human judged it a false positive)
    POST /admin/quarantine/{id}/purge  tombstone (drop the retained content, keep the decision)
    GET  /admin/login                  login form (unauthenticated)
    POST /admin/login                  exchange SYNC_TOKEN for a session cookie

Auth model (session cookie + CSRF token) — see the "Auth" section below for
the full rationale and the concrete tradeoff versus staying bearer-only.

Every `doc_sources` write on this router validates the submitted form data
through `app.config.SourceConfig` (or, for schedule_cron,
`sources_repo.validate_cron`) BEFORE touching the database. Nothing is ever
partially applied: config, schedule, and enabled-state are all validated
first; only if everything validates do we call into `sources_repo`.

# --- Auth --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CHOICE: session cookie (HMAC-signed, derived from SYNC_TOKEN) + a
# synchronizer CSRF token, NOT bearer-only.
#
# Bearer-only was rejected for THIS surface because "form posts must work
# from a browser": a plain HTML <form> cannot attach an `Authorization`
# header, so bearer-only would force the operator into a browser extension,
# a bookmarklet, or a non-browser client (curl/httpie) to drive an admin UI
# that is explicitly supposed to be clicked around in a browser. That
# defeats the point of building a UI at all.
#
# So: GET/POST /admin/login exchanges the existing `SYNC_TOKEN` (compared
# with `hmac.compare_digest`, same as `main._check_auth`) for an
# httponly + Secure + SameSite=Lax session cookie. The cookie VALUE is
# `f"{issued_at}.{HMAC-SHA256(SYNC_TOKEN, f'session-v1:{issued_at}')}"` — a
# value only a process that knows `SYNC_TOKEN` can compute — never the raw
# token itself, so a leaked cookie (log line, browser history, XSS) does not
# directly disclose `SYNC_TOKEN` (only a rotation-scoped equivalent that dies
# the moment the token is rotated).
#
# EXPIRY (added after security review M2): the issued-at timestamp is bound
# INTO the HMAC message, not merely appended alongside it — so editing the
# timestamp without knowing `SYNC_TOKEN` invalidates the digest, and the
# cookie is rejected outright by `_is_authenticated` (see there) rather than
# silently trusting a forged expiry. A session older than
# `SESSION_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` is rejected even though the digest still checks
# out, giving revocation-by-time without a server-side session store. 7 days
# was chosen as the max age: long enough that an operator doing routine
# source-review/approval work isn't forced to re-enter `SYNC_TOKEN` every
# session, short enough to bound how long a stolen cookie (e.g. captured by
# another container reaching `http://ingestion:8080/admin` over the shared
# `self-docs-internal` Docker network) stays usable without a full
# `SYNC_TOKEN` rotation.
#
# `Secure` is set on the cookie even though this service is published only
# on `127.0.0.1`: Chrome and Firefox both treat `http://127.0.0.1` (and
# `http://localhost`) as a "secure context" for cookie purposes, so this
# costs nothing in the current deployment, and it is the difference between
# safe and unsafe the moment this ever moves behind a reverse proxy (e.g.
# Traefik) that isn't terminating strictly loopback-only TLS.
#
# Every state-changing (POST) route additionally requires a hidden
# `csrf_token` form field equal to `HMAC-SHA256(SYNC_TOKEN, "csrf-v1")`,
# rendered into every form the templates emit. A cross-origin attacker
# forging a POST from another page cannot supply this value: they don't
# know `SYNC_TOKEN`, and same-origin policy stops them reading it out of an
# authenticated response even if the browser were to attach the session
# cookie to their forged request. `SameSite=Lax` on the cookie is defense
# in depth on top of that (blocks the cookie from being attached to a
# cross-site POST at all in compliant browsers).
#
# TRADEOFF (stated plainly): both the session value and the CSRF token are
# DETERMINISTIC functions of `SYNC_TOKEN`, not per-login random nonces —
# there is no server-side session store here (this service is otherwise
# stateless). That means every login shares the same cookie/CSRF pair until
# `SYNC_TOKEN` is rotated; a captured cookie remains valid until then
# (rotation is the only revocation mechanism). A production hardening step
# would swap this for a random per-session token in a small session store
# (or a signed, time-boxed JWT) — out of scope here, flagged for review.

# is a sync `def`, which Starlette runs in its worker thread pool, so a
# thread-level lock is the correct primitive for mutual exclusion across
# concurrent requests here.
#
# UNIFICATION (task B5): this used to be a lock this module owned outright,
# entirely independent of `app.main`'s `_sync_lock` — which meant a manual
# sync here and a `POST /sync` (or the scheduler) could run concurrently
# against the same source, corrupting `_delete_missing_pages`'s purge
# accounting. `admin.py` still must not import `app.main` at module level
# (that would be circular: `main.py` imports `admin.py` to mount its
# router), so instead of sharing a lock *reference* directly, this module
# exposes the acquire/release as two INJECTABLE SEAMS —
# `try_acquire_sync_lock` / `release_sync_lock` — following the exact same
# pattern `app.scheduler` already uses for its DB/sync/lock seams.
#
# Standalone (this module imported without `app.main`, e.g. by
# `tests/test_admin.py`), the seams default to `_manual_sync_lock` below, so
# this module stays fully self-contained and independently testable. At
# startup, `app.main` rebinds both seams to route through its own process-

    Shared by `upload_source_submit` (the edit-page upload form) and
    `create_source_submit` (the create form's optional file input), so both
    surfaces treat an uploaded batch identically.

    Raw bytes are read here via the blocking `upload.file.read()` sync file
    handle FastAPI provides to a `def` route, and handed to parsers that
    return in-memory `UploadedDoc`s — nothing here writes them to disk (the
    ASGI multipart parser may transiently spool a large file part to an OS
    temp file before `upload.file.read()` ever runs —
    `SpooledTemporaryFile`, framework-layer behavior, not something this
    function does; that file is cleaned up automatically at request end).

    `.zip` uploads go through `upload_zip.expand_zip` directly (not the thin
    `uploads.parse_upload` registry wrapper) so per-member failures can be
    surfaced individually; every other supported suffix goes through
    `uploads.parse_upload`.

    A part whose `filename` is empty/whitespace is SKIPPED, not parsed: a
    browser submits exactly such an empty part for an untouched
    `<input type="file">`, which every create-a-crawl-source submit from
    the (multipart) create form produces. Treating that as a parse failure
    would attach a bogus "unsupported file type: ''" error to submits that
    never attached a file at all.

    `UploadError` is swallowed into the returned error list and NEVER
    raised, so callers can always report a per-file problem instead of
    500ing. Any OTHER exception (a genuine parser bug) still propagates —
    callers that hold the sync lock must release it in a `finally`."""
