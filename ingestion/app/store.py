"""Hash-diff sync orchestration: crawl -> extract -> chunk -> embed -> upsert.

Drift handling (per IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §2 "Drift handling" and the T4
task description):

  - Page-level SHA-256 hash of the *extracted markdown* (not raw HTML) is the
    unit of change detection.
  - `doc_sources` gets a row per configured source (created on first sync,
    `base_url` kept in sync on later ones).
  - Pages whose hash is unchanged are skipped entirely (no re-embed, no
    write).
  - New/changed pages are replaced in ONE transaction per page: `DELETE FROM
    doc_pages WHERE url = ...` (cascades to `doc_chunks`), then reinsert the
    page row and its chunks/embeddings.
  - After a source's crawl completes, any `doc_pages` row for that source
    whose URL was not seen in this crawl is deleted (page removed upstream).
    Pages yielded with `fetch_ok=False` (attempted fetch failures like 503s or
    robots disallow) ARE added to `seen_urls`, protecting their existing rows
    from being purged while recording a page failure.
  - `doc_sources.last_synced`/`last_status` are updated at the end of every
    sync attempt. `last_status` is `ok` (no page failures), `partial` (some
    pages failed but at least one succeeded/was unchanged), or `failed`
    (source-level failure, e.g. the crawl itself raised — dead sitemap host,
    etc.).
  - When `crawler.crawl` reports its sitemap discovery was truncated at
    `max_pages` (a `crawl_summary` sentinel item with `truncated_at_cap:
    True` — see `crawler.crawl`'s docstring), `seen_urls` is a real but
    INCOMPLETE enumeration of the source. Deleting the "missing" pages is
    therefore unsafe: absence from an incomplete enumeration is not evidence
    of upstream removal, only of not having been sampled this run. This
    sync's `_delete_missing_pages` step is skipped entirely (same treatment
    as `crawl_aborted_early`) and the sync classifies as `partial` via
    `classify_sync`'s `crawl_truncated` parameter. Fixes the 2026 sync-drift
    incident where two sources (`gemini-api`, `google-search-console-api`)
    fetched exactly as many pages as they deleted on every run, because
    sitemap enumeration order is not stable and each run sampled a different
    arbitrary slice under the cap. (`crawler.discover_sitemap_urls` now also
    sorts URLs before applying the cap so repeated runs over an unchanged
    sitemap select the identical slice, independent of this guard.)

# --- Purge-ratio guard (defense in depth for _delete_missing_pages) --------------------
#
# A completed crawl's `seen_urls` is not always a trustworthy FULL
# enumeration of a source, even though it's non-empty: silent BFS fallback
# (sitemap fetch fails -> link-graph BFS from base_url, which routinely
# reaches a fraction of the sitemap's coverage) and sitemap `max_pages`
# truncation both complete normally while under-reporting. Naively trusting
# any non-empty `seen_urls` and deleting everything else can gut a source.
#
# A raw "refuse if we'd delete more than X% of the source" ratio is too
# blunt on its own: a *deliberate* corpus repair (e.g. narrowing an
# `include_prefixes` filter to drop pages that were always out of scope) can
# legitimately delete a similarly large fraction. The two need a second
# signal to tell apart. The distinguishing signature:
#   - a broken enumeration (BFS collapse, cap truncation) fetches FEW pages
#     and would delete MANY: low coverage, high deletion.
#   - a deliberate repair fetches MANY pages (a healthy, comparably-sized
#     re-crawl) while also deleting many: high coverage, high deletion.
# So the guard only refuses when a large deletion is paired with LOW crawl
# coverage of the existing corpus size — high coverage justifies a large
# deletion regardless of the ratio.
#
# Calibrated against the traefik repair (T12/R1 incident) with real,
# measured numbers (see docstring on `_delete_missing_pages`):
#   - intended repair:  397 existing, ~280 fetched (coverage 0.705), ~232
#     purged (delete ratio 0.584)         -> must be PERMITTED
#   - BFS-collapse scenario: 397 existing, ~60 fetched (coverage 0.151),
#     ~337 purged (delete ratio 0.849)    -> must be REFUSED
# 0.5 / 0.3 sits with comfortable margin on both signals for both cases (the
# repair's 0.705 coverage clears the 0.3 floor by 0.4; the collapse's 0.151
# coverage misses it by 0.15) — see `_delete_missing_pages` for the exact
# comparison.
PURGE_DELETE_RATIO_THRESHOLD = 0.5
PURGE_FETCH_COVERAGE_FLOOR = 0.3

# Below this many existing pages, the ratio guard doesn't engage at all —
# a handful of pages moving by one or two is a 50%+ ratio on paper but not a
# meaningful signal of a broken enumeration, and real sources this small
# (tests, brand-new sources) shouldn't be hamstrung by it. The unconditional
# empty-`seen_urls` guard below still applies regardless of size.
PURGE_RATIO_GUARD_MIN_EXISTING_PAGES = 20

# --- Sync status classification --------------------------------------------
#
# 2026-07-26 sync-health incident: a 40-source production run reported
# `last_status="ok"` for every single source — including 6 that indexed zero
# pages and traefik, which silently lost 117/280 pages (42%) to soft
# failures. Root cause was an implicit conditional chain where
# `pages_soft_failed` counted toward both `pages_seen` (defeating the
# "empty crawl" failed-guard) and `succeeded_any` (making any nonzero
# soft-failure count look like a "success" as long as the HARD-failure
# counter `pages_failed` was zero). `classify_sync` below replaces that
# chain with an explicit, directly unit-testable set of ordered rules — see
# its docstring for the exact rule order.
#
# Ratio above which soft failures alone (zero hard failures) demote an
# otherwise-clean sync from "ok" to "partial". Calibrated against the
# traefik incident: 117/280 = 0.418 soft-failure ratio, comfortably above
# this floor -> must be "partial". A source with only a couple of
# incidental soft failures out of hundreds of pages shouldn't flap to
# "partial" on every run, hence a floor rather than "any soft failure at
# all counts".
SOFT_FAIL_PARTIAL_RATIO = 0.2

# --- JS-shell detection (T6) -------------------------------------------------
#
# Same traefik incident, a level deeper: `extraction_too_short` already
# reported all 117 soft failures, but flattened two very different failure
# modes into one bucket. 115 of those 117 extracted to EXACTLY 61 characters
# — an identical byte length recurring across unrelated URLs, which is not
# a property genuinely-short-but-real pages have (their lengths scatter:
# 140, 142, 152, 162, 163, 167, 179, 180, 183, 185, 196, 197 in the same
# run). An identical length across many pages is the fingerprint of a
# client-side-rendered shell: the server returns the same static
# HTML/noscript template for every route, so trafilatura/BS4 extract
# byte-for-byte the same stub text no matter which URL was requested.
#
# The signal is inherently CROSS-PAGE — a single 61-char page is
# indistinguishable from a genuinely tiny page (see the "45 x 2" pair below,
# which must NOT be flagged). It only becomes conclusive once enough *other*
# pages in the SAME source land on the exact same length, so detection has
# to accumulate every soft-failed page's length across the whole crawl and
# only classify at the end of `sync_source`'s per-source loop — it cannot
# live in `extract.py`, which only ever sees one page at a time.
#
# MIN_SHELL_SIBLING_COUNT = 3: the real run's own false-candidate — 45 chars
# recurring on exactly 2 pages — is *not* a shell (two unrelated pages can
# coincidentally land on the same short length), so the threshold must
# clear 2. Requiring 3 does that with a full page of margin while still
# catching the real incident (61 chars x 115) by nearly two orders of
# magnitude, and it comfortably ignores the singleton lengths (140 x 1, 152
# x 1, ...) in the long tail of genuinely-short pages.
#
# Length-match tolerance = 0 (exact match, not a +/- N window): a shell page
# is the literal same static template re-served for every route, so
# extraction produces a byte-identical length every time — there is no
# reason for two real shell pages to differ even by one character. Grouping
# by exact length (rather than a fuzzy window) also avoids accidentally
# lumping together unrelated genuinely-short pages that merely happen to
# sit close to each other (e.g. 162 and 163, or 196 and 197 above) into a
# false shell group.
MIN_SHELL_SIBLING_COUNT = 3

# Circuit breaker for the headless-render retry loop (review finding #9):
# bail out of retrying further suspected shell pages once this many renders
# in a row have come back `None` (renderer down/unreachable/timing out),

# suspect. 3 mirrors the tenacity retry-attempt count used elsewhere in this

    `guard_refused_out`, if given, is a caller-owned list this function
    appends `True` to when (and only when) the purge-RATIO guard (case 2
    below) is the reason nothing was deleted — as opposed to the
    unconditional empty-`seen_urls` refusal (case 1) or simply having
    nothing to delete. Callers (namely `sync_source`) use this to feed
    `classify_sync`'s `purge_guard_refused` signal without duplicating the
    ratio math here.

    Two layers of defense in depth, both bypassed by `force_delete_all=True`
    (an explicit, deliberate "wipe this source" opt-in — `sync_source` never
    passes it; this function is not where that operation should live):

    1. An EMPTY `seen_urls` is always refused as a no-op. An empty seen-set
       almost never means "this source legitimately has zero pages now" —
       far more likely a transient upstream failure (DNS blip, 5xx,
       timed-out sitemap) made the crawl see nothing, and deleting
       everything on that basis is the single most destructive thing this
       pipeline can do.

    2. For sources with at least `PURGE_RATIO_GUARD_MIN_EXISTING_PAGES`
       existing pages, a large deletion is refused UNLESS it's paired with
       comparably large crawl coverage — see the module-level comment above
       `PURGE_DELETE_RATIO_THRESHOLD` for the full rationale. Concretely,
       measured against the traefik repair this guard exists for (397
       existing `doc_pages` rows):

         repair (must be PERMITTED):     fetched ~280 -> coverage 0.705
                                          purge   ~232 -> delete ratio 0.584
         BFS collapse (must be REFUSED): fetched ~60  -> coverage 0.151
                                          purge   ~337 -> delete ratio 0.849

       The repair's delete ratio (0.584) is actually the higher of the two,
       which is exactly why ratio alone can't distinguish them — its
       coverage (0.705) is what clears it: comfortably above the 0.3 floor
       (margin +0.405), while the collapse's coverage (0.151) comfortably
       misses it (margin -0.149). The guard only refuses when BOTH the
       delete ratio exceeds `PURGE_DELETE_RATIO_THRESHOLD` AND the coverage
       ratio is below `PURGE_FETCH_COVERAGE_FLOOR` — a large purge with
       healthy coverage (the repair) is allowed through.

    Note on Snapshot Semantics (S1 & S3 compatibility):
    Under S1 autocommit (`replace_page` commits each page immediately as iterated),
    querying `SELECT count(*) FROM doc_pages` inside `_delete_missing_pages` observes
    a post-crawl snapshot where newly discovered pages have already been inserted,
    distorting `delete_ratio` downward and `coverage_ratio` upward relative to the
    calibrated pre-sync thresholds. Furthermore, under S3 (`fetch_ok=False` items added
    to `seen_urls` to protect existing rows from being deleted), including fetch failures
    in `coverage_ratio` would allow a mass-fetch-failure run to clear the 0.3 floor.
    Therefore, `_delete_missing_pages` evaluates against `existing_count` (the pre-sync
    row count of `doc_pages` before any new insertions) and `successful_seen_count`
    (the count of `seen_urls` excluding `fetch_ok=False` failures).

    #      "missing" pages would delete everything the crawl hadn't reached
    #      yet (in the worst case, an abort on page 1, that's every page).
    #   2. A crawl that ran to completion but yielded ZERO pages — e.g. a
    #      transient upstream outage (sitemap 5xx, DNS blip) that BFS/sitemap
    #      fallback swallows into "nothing found" rather than an exception.
    #      `crawl_aborted_early` is False here, but `seen_urls` is just as
    #      untrustworthy: it says nothing about which pages still exist
    #      upstream, only that the crawler saw none of them this run.
    #   3. `crawl_truncated` — sitemap discovery hit `max_pages` (or ran out
    #      of budget before processing every child sitemap) before it could
    #      enumerate the full in-scope corpus. Unlike case 1, every page the

    `sync_source` directly, so a Prometheus sample is recorded for every
    completed sync regardless of which layer triggered it (see
    `app.metrics` for the recording logic and why it lives in a separate
    leaf module rather than here or in `main.py`).

    Calls the module-level `sync_source` by its bare name (not
    `self.sync_source`) so a test that monkeypatches `store.sync_source`
    (e.g. `ingestion/tests/test_sync_health.py`'s admin-path characterization
    test) is still honored here -- this wrapper adds instrumentation, it
    does not hardcode which underlying implementation runs.

    Tolerates a `sync_source` double with a narrower signature (no
    `cancel_event`, or no `progress_cb`/`cancel_event` at all), e.g. a test
    monkeypatch. This is done by inspecting `sync_source`'s signature ONCE
    up front and only passing the keyword arguments it actually accepts,
    rather than calling it and catching `TypeError` -- a `TypeError` raised
    from deep inside a real `sync_source` body (extract/chunk/embed) is
    indistinguishable from a signature mismatch, so a catch-and-retry ladder

    document batch instead of a live crawl.

    Per doc: the page URL is the sentinel `upload://{source.name}/{doc.rel_path}`.
    `hash_markdown(doc.markdown)` is compared against the existing
    `doc_pages.content_hash` for that URL (via `get_existing_page_hash`) —
    unchanged content is skipped (`pages_skipped` +1, no re-chunk/re-embed,
    same as `sync_source`'s unchanged-page path); new or changed content is
    run through `chunker.chunk_markdown` -> `embedder.embed_chunks` ->
    `replace_page`, exactly the same call shapes `sync_source` uses.

    Raises `ValueError` immediately (before touching anything) if
    `source.source_type != 'upload'` — this function must never be pointed
    at a crawl source; use `sync_source`/`sync_source_with_metrics` for
    those.

    Deliberately NEVER calls `_delete_missing_pages`: unlike a crawl, one
    upload batch is never a complete enumeration of the source's pages (a
    user can upload a handful of files at a time, across many separate
    batches), so a page's absence from THIS batch is never evidence it was
    removed. Any page from a prior batch simply survives untouched.

    Status classification reuses `classify_sync` with its default
    (crawl-only) signals all left at their defaults (`crawl_aborted_early`/
    `purge_guard_refused`/`crawl_truncated` all False, which don't apply to
    an upload batch) — this already yields exactly the required semantics
    for an upload batch: `pages_fetched + pages_skipped == 0` (nothing
    succeeded) -> "failed"; `pages_failed > 0` with at least one success ->
    "partial"; otherwise -> "ok".

    `progress_cb`, when given, is called as `progress_cb(outcome, url)`
    after every doc (success, skip, or failure) — identical signature and
    per-item cadence to `sync_source`'s `progress_cb`, so a caller (the admin
    upload route) can wire live progress into the same `_sync_status` widget
    used for crawl syncs.
