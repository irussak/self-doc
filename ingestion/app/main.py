"""FastAPI service wrapper for the ingestion engine.

Endpoints (per IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §2 and the T4/B1 task descriptions):

  - POST /sync    {"sources": [names]} or {"source": id|name} optional -> runs
                  a sync as a background task guarded by an asyncio lock; a
                  second call while one is running returns 409. `source`
                  (single id or name, for the admin UI's manual-sync button)
                  and `sources` (a list of names, today's contract) are
                  mutually exclusive — `source` wins if both are given. With
                  neither, every ACTIVE source is synced (today's default,
                  unchanged in the common case). Requires
                  `Authorization: Bearer $SYNC_TOKEN`.
  - GET  /status  per-source last-run summary + top-level {"running": bool}.
  - GET  /health  200 liveness probe.
  - GET  /metrics prometheus-client exposition.

`SYNC_TOKEN` is REQUIRED: the process refuses to start (exits non-zero) if
it is unset, at import time — before uvicorn ever binds a socket. It must
also not be a known placeholder/shipped-default value when any listener is
non-loopback (see `app.security` and `SELF_DOCS_LISTENERS`); on a
loopback-only deployment a placeholder warns instead of refusing.

`doc_sources` (the database) is the sole source of truth for crawl config —
see `app.sources_repo`. There is no `sources.yaml` seed file anymore
(`ingestion/config/` holds only a `.gitkeep` so the Docker build has a
directory to bind-mount) and no boot-time import path: `sources_repo.
import_from_yaml` still exists and is still exercised by
`ingestion/tests/test_sources_repo.py`, but nothing in this module (or
anywhere else) calls it — it is a programmatic-only helper, not wired into
startup. Sources land in `doc_sources` via the admin UI, the MCP
`propose_doc_source` tool (pending-row human approval), or
`scripts/push_sources.py`.

# --- Unified sync lock -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE lock: a single `threading.Lock`, shared by all three sync entrypoints
# (`POST /sync`, the admin manual-sync route, and the scheduler). Before this
# task these were THREE independent, non-cooperating mechanisms:
#   1. `POST /sync`      -> this module's own `asyncio.Lock`
#   2. admin manual sync -> `admin._manual_sync_lock`, a *different*
#                            `threading.Lock` instance
#   3. the scheduler     -> `scheduler.is_sync_locked_fn`, an unwired seam
#                            that always reported "not locked"
# — meaning any two of the three could run a sync concurrently against the
# same source, corrupting `_delete_missing_pages`'s purge accounting (see
# scheduler.py's and this task's dispatch for the calibrated PERMIT/REFUSE
# ratios that depend on a single, uninterrupted `seen_urls` set per source).
#
# CHOICE: `threading.Lock`, not `asyncio.Lock`, as the ONE shared primitive.
# Rationale:
#   - `admin.py`'s routes are sync `def`s run in Starlette's worker thread
#     pool — an `asyncio.Lock` is not safe to acquire/release from a thread
#     that isn't running the event loop (no cross-thread guarantees), so the
#     lock had to move to `threading`, not the other way around.
#   - A `threading.Lock` is perfectly safe to use from the event-loop thread
#     too, AS LONG AS every acquire is non-blocking (`acquire(blocking=False)`)
#     — a blocking acquire would freeze the event loop. Every call site here
#     uses the non-blocking form, so the same lock instance serves the sync
#     `/sync`+scheduler async code and admin's sync route without special-
#     casing either.
#   - `.release()` on a plain `threading.Lock` (unlike `RLock`) is not
#     restricted to the thread that acquired it, which matters because
#     `/sync`'s acquire happens on the request-handling
#     thread/event-loop-turn but its release happens inside a worker thread
#     via `asyncio.to_thread` (`_sync_task`).
#
# WIRING (breaks the circular import `admin.py` flagged): `admin.py` and
# `scheduler.py` each expose their own lock-related seam (`admin.
# try_acquire_sync_lock`/`release_sync_lock`, `scheduler.is_sync_locked_fn`)
# defaulting to a private, module-local fallback so each stays importable
# and independently testable with NO knowledge of `app.main`. Since
# `app.main` already imports both `admin` and `scheduler` (to mount the
# router and start the scheduler task), and neither of THEM imports
# `app.main`, there is no cycle: `main.py` simply rebinds those seams, once,
# at the bottom of this module (see "Startup wiring" below) to route through
# `_sync_lock` below instead of each module's private default.

# --- Request body size cap --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Pure ASGI middleware (not `BaseHTTPMiddleware`): the 413 is sent directly
# via `send()` rather than raised as an exception through the app stack,
# because an exception raised out of `receive()` would otherwise be caught
# by Starlette's outermost `ServerErrorMiddleware` (added automatically,
# always the OUTERMOST wrapper regardless of `add_middleware` call order)
# and turned into a generic 500 -- not the 413 this middleware exists to
# produce. Registered below via `app.add_middleware(...)`, which accepts
# any `cls(app, **options)`-shaped ASGI callable, not just
# `BaseHTTPMiddleware` subclasses.
#
# Two-path enforcement of `uploads.MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`:
#   1. `Content-Length` header over the limit -> reject with 413
#      IMMEDIATELY, before `receive()` is ever called (the body is never
#      read at all in this path).
#   2. No usable `Content-Length` (missing, or chunked transfer-encoding
#      the ASGI server has already stripped down to a stream of
#      `http.request` messages) -> accumulate the `body` bytes off each
#      ASGI message as they arrive and reject with 413 the moment the
#      running total exceeds the limit, WITHOUT waiting for the rest of
#      the stream. This is the actual bypass this middleware closes: a
#      Content-Length-only check is trivially defeated by omitting the
#      header.
# When the body turns out to be within bounds, the `http.request` messages
# consumed here (to measure it) are buffered and replayed verbatim via
# `buffered_receive` so the wrapped app/route sees an identical stream.
#
# Scoped to POST/PUT/PATCH only: any other method (GET/HEAD/DELETE/...) or
# non-"http" ASGI scope (lifespan, websocket) returns through `self.app`
# on the very first line, with zero header parsing or receive-wrapping --
# `GET /health` and `GET /metrics` never enter the size-check branch at
# all.
#
# --- T20 MEDIUM fix: bound AGGREGATE memory across CONCURRENT requests ------------------
#
# The per-request `max_bytes` cap above only bounds what a SINGLE request can
# buffer. It does nothing to stop N concurrent requests from each streaming
# up to `max_bytes` at once -- worst case, N * max_bytes resident at the same
# time, and since this middleware runs BEFORE routing and BEFORE auth
# (`require_session`/`require_csrf` haven't run yet for any POST/PUT/PATCH),
# an unauthenticated caller can drive that worst case simply by opening many
# concurrent large POSTs, even to a path that will ultimately 404 and never
# reads its body itself. Measured: 6 concurrent 49 MiB unauthenticated POSTs
# to a nonexistent path drove RSS from ~211 MiB to ~446 MiB and it stayed
# there.
#
# Fix: a module-level counter tracks the TOTAL bytes currently buffered by
# this middleware across every in-flight request in this process. Each chunk
# is reserved against `_INFLIGHT_CAP_BYTES` as it arrives (before being
# appended to this request's own `buffered` list); if reserving would push
# the aggregate over the cap, THIS request is rejected immediately (503,
# before consuming any more of the stream) rather than being allowed to pile
# on top of what's already buffered. Every request's reservation is released
# (in a `finally`) once its own buffered data is no longer needed -- either
# because it was rejected, or because the downstream app has finished
# reading it via `buffered_receive`. This bounds worst-case resident memory
# from this middleware to a fixed ceiling REGARDLESS of how many requests
# arrive concurrently, closing the gap the per-request cap alone left open.
