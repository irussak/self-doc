**self-docs** gives your coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Antigravity, or any
MCP client) a private, always-current reference library. It crawls upstream
documentation sites and indexes uploaded documents, chunks and embeds them locally — no third-party embedding
API — and exposes hybrid semantic search as MCP tools over streamable HTTP.

## Why self-docs

- **Broad Indexing.** The pipeline indexes both crawled sites **and** uploaded documents (Markdown/text, HTML, PDF, zip bundles).
- **Local-first embeddings.** FastEmbed runs in-process on CPU (ONNX, no
  GPU/torch); documentation never leaves your network. The model is selectable
  from a registry (`config/models.yaml`) — `make configure` derives the vector
  dimension and container memory limits from your choice. Default:
  `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (384-dim) — compose defaults, both Dockerfiles'
  build `ARG`s, both services' code-level fallbacks, and the committed
  `db/init/01_schema.sql` schema all agree on this out of the box, with no
  `.env` required.
- **Hybrid retrieval.** Vector similarity + per-source-language Postgres
  full-text search over `pgvector`, so exact terms and semantic matches both
  surface.
- **Efficient re-crawling.** Sources can prefer a site's
  [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org) index over HTML crawling, and re-syncs use
  HTTP conditional GET (`ETag`/`If-Modified-Since`) to skip unchanged pages
  before download — see [ADR-003](docs/adr/003-llms-txt-etag-multilang-fts.md). An optional headless `renderer` service is also available for single-page applications.
- **Agent-native.** Ships as MCP tools (`search_docs`, `list_doc_sources`,
  `propose_doc_source`, `upload_doc_text`) over streamable HTTP — wire it into any MCP client.
- **Operator-friendly.** Crawl targets and upload sources live in the database, managed through a
  loopback-only admin UI or proposed by agents for human approval.
- **Self-hostable.** One `docker compose` stack; a Traefik overlay for
  home-lab ingress. CI publishes **pre-built multi-arch images
  (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`), one per embedding model**, so you can run
  the whole thing without cloning this repo or building anything — see
  [Quickstart — Pre-Built Images](#quickstart--pre-built-images-no-clone).

| Layer | Technology | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Store** | PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector 0.8.2 | Stores metadata, crawl/upload sources, and embeddings. |
| **Embeddings** | FastEmbed | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (registry default, selectable via `config/models.yaml`) |
| **MCP server** | FastMCP 3.x (streamable HTTP) | Exposes search, proposal, and upload tools to AI agents. |
| **CLI & Skill** | `doc-cli` Go binary + embedded skill | Progressive disclosure AI agent skill for token-efficient retrieval. |
| **Ingestion** | FastAPI crawler & API | Handles crawling, document uploads, chunking, and progressive disclosure endpoints (`/api/v1/*`). |
| **Renderer** | Headless Browser (Optional) | Resolves JavaScript-heavy or SPA documentation sources. |
| **Ingress** | Traefik | Production overlay for secure home-lab routing. |

Source configuration (crawl targets, URL prefixes, upload sources, schedule) lives in the `doc_sources` table — **not** a YAML file. 

Sources can be of two `source_type`s: **crawl** or **upload**. They are managed through the loopback-only admin UI at `/admin`, or (for crawl sources) proposed by an agent via the `propose_doc_source` MCP tool (which queues a `pending` row for human approval and never crawls on its own). The ingestion service includes an opt-in in-process cron scheduler (`app.scheduler`) for automated re-crawling; see the [Runbook](docs/runbook.md) for configuration details.

## Quickstart — Local Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # fill in real values
make configure              # optional — pick an embedding model (see below)
make up                     # db + ingestion (:8080) + mcp-server (:8081)
make sync                   # trigger the initial documentation sync
```

`make configure` is optional: with no `.env` overrides both services already use
the registry default. Run it to choose a different model —
`make configure MODEL=BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` — and it resolves that model's
vector dimension, query/passage prompts, and per-service memory limits into
`.env`, then re-renders `db/init/01_schema.sql`. Switching models on an existing
deployment requires a re-embed; see
[Runbook → switch the embedding model](docs/runbook.md#switch-the-embedding-model).

Point local MCP clients at `http://127.0.0.1:8081/mcp` (streamable HTTP). The
server requires an `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_TOKEN>` header — see
[Client Setup](docs/client-setup.md) for per-client configuration.

## Quickstart — Pre-Built Images (No Clone)

Every push to `main` publishes ready-to-run images for both services to GitHub
Container Registry. You do **not** need this repository, a build toolchain, or
`make` to run self-docs — only Docker, a compose file, and the database's init
SQL.

```
ghcr.io/adamrussak/self-docs-ingestion
ghcr.io/adamrussak/self-docs-mcp-server
```

### Which tag do I pull?

The embedding model is **baked into the image at build time** (the ONNX weights
are pre-downloaded so the container works offline and pays no cold-start
download), so one image cannot serve more than one model. The model is encoded
in the **tag** instead:

| Tag | What it is |
|-----|------------|
| `latest` | The registry-default model — `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`, 384-dim. Start here. |
| `bge-small-en-v1.5` | Same model, named explicitly — pin this instead of `latest` for reproducibility. |
| `bge-base-en-v1.5` | `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`, 768-dim. |
| `mxbai-embed-large-v1` | `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1`, 1024-dim. |
| `multilingual-e5-large` | `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large`, 1024-dim. |

Version-pinned forms exist too — `v1.2.3-<model-tag>` and `sha-<commit>-<model-tag>`
for every model, plus bare `v1.2.3` / `sha-<commit>` for the default one. The
full scheme, and the always-current model list, live in
[Runbook → Pre-built Container Images](docs/runbook.md#pre-built-container-images-ghcr).

> [!WARNING]
> **Both services must run the same model tag, and the database schema's
> `vector(N)` must match that model's dimension.** Mixing them — e.g. pulling
> `:latest` (384-dim) against a schema created for a 1024-dim model — fails
> every insert and every query with a pgvector dimension mismatch. The
> installer below handles this for you (it verifies the pulled image's labels
> against the schema it renders and refuses to start on a mismatch); the
> manual path does not, so get it right by hand there.

These tags have been live since release **v0.1.0** (the release that
introduced the per-model image matrix — see
[Runbook → Pre-built Container Images](docs/runbook.md#pre-built-container-images-ghcr)).

> [!WARNING]
> **Ignore any `v0.0.1`, `v0.0.2`, or other `0.0.x` tag you see in GHCR.**
> Those predate the per-model matrix: they were built with
> `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1` (1024-dim) regardless of what you pass
> for `--model`/`EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME`, and they carry **no**
> `io.self-docs.*` labels at all. Pulling one against, say, the default
> 384-dim schema is a silent dimension mismatch waiting to happen. The
> installer's label check (below) refuses images with no labels and fails
> closed, but the safe move is simpler: don't pass `--version 0.0.x` in the
> first place — use `>= v0.1.0`.

Verify what a pulled image actually contains before trusting it:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/adamrussak/self-docs-ingestion:latest \
  --format '{{json (index .Image "linux/amd64").Config.Labels}}'
# → includes io.self-docs.embedding-model and io.self-docs.embedding-dim
```

### Install with `deploy/install.sh`

The `deploy/` kit is one installer script plus the compose file and manifest
it copies for you. Download it, **read it**, then run it — this is
deliberately not a `curl … | bash` one-liner; you should know what a script
you pulled off the network is about to do before it touches Docker or your
filesystem:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdamRussak/self-doc/<tag>/deploy/install.sh -o install.sh
less install.sh    # read it — no external deps beyond curl/docker
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh --model bge-base-en-v1.5 --dir ./self-docs --version 0.1.0
```

> [!WARNING]
> **The `<tag>` URL above is not live yet.** `deploy/` — this installer,
> `docker-compose.yml`, and `models.tsv` — exists only on this feature
> branch as of today; the latest release, **`v0.1.0`, predates it**. So
> `.../v0.1.0/deploy/install.sh` 404s, and no other tag today has
> `deploy/models.tsv` or `deploy/docker-compose.yml` either.
> `install.sh`'s own network fallback (used once you already have the
> script, to fetch everything else) points at `.../main/...`, which doesn't
> have `deploy/` yet either. This will become a real, working command once
> this branch merges to `main` and the next release tag (`v0.1.1` or later —
> tags are cut automatically by the release workflow's patch-bump step)
> contains `deploy/`; use that tag in place of `<tag>` once it exists.
> **Until then**, run the installer from a
> local checkout instead — everything else below (flags, behavior, output)
> is identical:
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/AdamRussak/self-doc.git && cd self-doc
> deploy/install.sh --source-dir . --model bge-base-en-v1.5 --dir ../self-docs
> ```
> `--source-dir <path>` makes the installer read `deploy/models.tsv`,
> `deploy/docker-compose.yml`, and `db/init/*.sql` from `<path>` instead of
> the network — see [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).

The three flags a first run actually needs:

| Flag | Default | Why you'd set it |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `--model <name\|slug>` | registry default (`bge-small-en-v1.5`) | Pick the embedding model — slug or full HF name, e.g. `bge-base-en-v1.5` or `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`. |
| `--dir <path>` | `./self-docs` | Where `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `db/init/` get written. Lets you keep more than one install (e.g. one per model) side by side. |
| `--version <X.Y.Z>` | unset (floats the moving `<slug>` tag) | Pin to a specific release instead of whatever currently carries that model's slug tag. Must be `>= 0.1.0` — see the stale-tag warning above. |

`install.sh` also validates ports are free, that Docker Compose v2 is
present, renders `db/init/01_schema.sql` for the chosen model's dimension,
writes a `0600` `.env` with generated secrets, pulls both images, verifies
their `io.self-docs.*` labels match the selected model **before** starting
anything, then brings the stack up and waits for it to report healthy. The
full flag list, what each installed file is, and the exit-code table are in
[`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) (or run `deploy/install.sh --help`).
Fetching over HTTPS and checking image labels are not the same as verifying
who built what you're running — see
[`deploy/README.md` → What this installer trusts](deploy/README.md#what-this-installer-trusts)
before you point `--owner` at anything you don't control.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual install (no script)</strong></summary>

Do this instead of running `install.sh` if you'd rather see every step, or if
you're scripting your own install tooling around the raw images/SQL/compose
file. It reaches the same end state, by hand.

#### 1. Fetch the database init SQL

Postgres applies these once, on an empty volume, to create the schema the
services expect. They are the only files you need from this repo:

```bash
mkdir -p self-docs/db/init && cd self-docs
base=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdamRussak/self-doc/main/db/init
for f in 01_schema.sql 02_sources_config.sql 03_fix_embedding_dim.sql 04_upload_sources.sql 05_injection_quarantine.sql; do
  curl -fsSL "$base/$f" -o "db/init/$f"
done
```

Unlike `deploy/`, `db/init/` already exists on `main` today, so this `base`
URL (unpinned to a tag) works right now.

The committed `01_schema.sql` is rendered `vector(384)` — correct for the
registry-default model, `bge-small-en-v1.5` (what `:latest` currently points
at — see the warning below on why this walkthrough pins the slug instead).
**For a different model**, render the schema for its dimension instead (768 for
`bge-base-en-v1.5`, 1024 for `mxbai-embed-large-v1` and `multilingual-e5-large`):

```bash
curl -fsSL "$base/01_schema.sql.template" \
  | sed 's/__EMBEDDING_DIM__/1024/' > db/init/01_schema.sql
```

#### 2. Write `.env`

```bash
cat > .env <<'EOF'
POSTGRES_USER=self_docs
POSTGRES_DB=self_docs
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=                      # openssl rand -hex 32
SYNC_TOKEN=                              # openssl rand -hex 32 — also gates the /admin UI
MCP_TOKEN=                               # openssl rand -hex 32 — mcp-server refuses to start without it
SELF_DOCS_IMAGE_TAG=bge-small-en-v1.5    # keep in lockstep with EMBEDDING_* below
EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5
EMBEDDING_DIM=384
EMBEDDING_QUERY_PROMPT="Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages: "
EMBEDDING_PASSAGE_PROMPT=""
EOF
```

> [!NOTE]
> `SELF_DOCS_IMAGE_TAG` is pinned to the model's slug (`bge-small-en-v1.5`),
> **not** `latest` — see the tag table and WARNING above for why floating on
> `latest` is unsafe once a future release moves it to a different
> model/dimension. This matters *more* here than in the installer path:
> `install.sh` verifies the pulled image's `io.self-docs.*` labels against
> the schema it renders and refuses to start on a mismatch, but this manual
> walkthrough has no equivalent check — a stale `.env`/schema pairing here
> fails silently at the pgvector layer instead of at startup.

Quote the prompts: bge/mxbai expect a **trailing space** before the query text,
and quoting is what keeps it from being stripped.

For a non-default model, set all five model variables together — the tag, the
name, the dimension, and the two prompts. The per-model prompt and memory
values are listed in
[`config/models.yaml`](config/models.yaml) (`query_prompt` / `passage_prompt`
are applied by the services and differ per family: bge and mxbai prompt the
query only, e5 prompts both sides).

#### 3. Write `docker-compose.yml` and start

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: pgvector/pgvector:0.8.2-pg16
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
    volumes:

      EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME: ${EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME}
      EMBEDDING_QUERY_PROMPT: "${EMBEDDING_QUERY_PROMPT}"
    ports:

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8080/sync -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYNC_TOKEN"
```

</details>

Whichever path you used, add sources at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin` (or
your `--port-api`) and point MCP clients at `http://127.0.0.1:8081/mcp` (or
your `--port-mcp`) with an `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_TOKEN>` header
([Client Setup](docs/client-setup.md)). `install.sh` prints both URLs, plus a
ready-to-run sync-trigger `curl` command, when it finishes.

> [!NOTE]
> Changing the model later means new vectors *and* a new column width, so it is
> not a tag swap: pull the new tag, re-render `01_schema.sql`, recreate the
> volume, and re-sync. See
> [Runbook → switch the embedding model](docs/runbook.md#switch-the-embedding-model)
> and, for an installer-created deployment specifically,
> [Runbook → operating an installer-created deployment](docs/runbook.md#operating-an-installer-created-deployment).

For LAN-wide access behind Traefik with TLS, use the repo's
`docker-compose.prod.yml` overlay — see
[Quickstart — Production](#quickstart--production-home-lab--traefik). (The
`deploy/` kit is loopback-only by design and does not include Traefik; see
[Runbook → operating an installer-created deployment](docs/runbook.md#operating-an-installer-created-deployment).)

## Go CLI & Progressive Disclosure Skill (`doc-cli`)

`doc-cli` is a high-performance Go CLI and progressive disclosure skill that allows terminal AI agents (and human operators) to query self-docs efficiently over the REST API (`/api/v1/*`).

```bash
# Install binary (~/.local/bin/doc-cli) and register global AI skill (~/.gemini/config/skills/doc-cli/SKILL.md)
make install
```

### Agent Progressive Disclosure Protocol (3-Step Workflow)

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/doc_cli_sequence_board.png" alt="doc-cli Progressive Disclosure Sequence Board Diagram" width="100%" />
</p>

1. **Search First (Token-Efficient Candidate Fetch)**:
   ```bash
   doc-cli search "fastapi dependency injection" --limit 3
   ```
   *Returns candidate chunk IDs, heading paths, relevance scores, and 1-line snippets.*

2. **Inspect Candidate IDs**:
   Agent evaluates the candidate IDs and heading paths returned.

3. **Targeted Fetch by ID**:
   ```bash
   doc-cli get 42
   ```
   *Fetches exact markdown content for the specified chunk ID.*

### Skill Diagnostics & Management

```bash
doc-cli skill status         # Check global/project skill installation and API health
doc-cli skill install        # Install skill globally (~/.gemini/config/skills/doc-cli/SKILL.md)
doc-cli skill install --project # Install skill locally (.agents/skills/doc-cli/SKILL.md)
```

## Quickstart — Production (Home-Lab + Traefik)

Deploy behind Traefik ingress on a home-lab server:

```bash
cp .env.example .env                    # set credentials + DOCS_MCP_HOSTNAME
export MCP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)  # required — persist this in .env
make up-prod                            # applies docker-compose.prod.yml overlay
make sync                               # trigger the initial documentation sync
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`MCP_TOKEN` is mandatory.** If it is missing from `.env`, `mcp-server`
> fails fast on startup and restart-loops. When upgrading an existing
> deployment, update every client config with the `Authorization` header
> **before or alongside** restarting `mcp-server`. Follow the
> [MCP_TOKEN upgrade checklist](docs/runbook.md#deploy--upgrade--mcp_token-requirement-read-before-restarting-mcp-server)
> in the runbook.

## MCP Tools & REST Endpoints

### MCP Server Tools (Streamable HTTP)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_docs(query, source?, limit?)` | Hybrid vector + full-text search over indexed docs. <br/>*(Note: `upload://` URLs from uploaded sources render as plain text)* |
| `list_doc_sources()` | List indexed documentation sets with sync status. **Now reports `source_type`** (crawl or upload). |
| `propose_doc_source(name, base_url, max_pages, ...)` | Propose a new source; lands as `pending` and stays uncrawlable until approved in the admin UI — never crawls itself. |
| `upload_doc_text(source, title, content)` | Writes a page of Markdown/text into an **existing** upload-type source. <br/>**Limits**: 1 MB content, 200-character title. Re-uploading the same title replaces the page. |

### Ingestion Service REST Endpoints (`/api/v1/*`)

| Endpoint | Subcommand / Usage | Description |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| `GET /api/v1/search?q=<query>&limit=3` | `doc-cli search "<query>"` | Fast hybrid search returning candidate IDs, scores, and snippets (~50–150 tokens) |
| `GET /api/v1/chunks/{id}` | `doc-cli get <id>` | Targeted retrieval returning full markdown content for a specific chunk |

## Managing Sources

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Add / edit / remove a source | Admin UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin` (loopback only). |
| Create an upload source | Admin UI "Create Source" form using the "Uploaded files" radio button. |
| Populate an upload source | 1. **Admin UI**: Edit-page upload form.<br/>2. **CLI**: `make upload SOURCE=<name> PATH=<file_or_dir>`<br/>3. **MCP Tool**: `upload_doc_text(source, title, content)` |
| Agent-proposed source | `propose_doc_source` MCP tool → `pending` → human approval. |
| Trigger a sync | `make sync` (or the per-source internal scheduler). |
| Approval workflow | [Runbook → adding sources](docs/runbook.md) |

## Development

```bash
# Start an isolated db for testing
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d db

# Run the full suite (unit + integration + e2e)
make test

# Run the retrieval-quality eval (requires a synced db)
make eval

# Lint and static type checks (also enforced in CI)
make lint
make typecheck
```

### Data & System Operations

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `make upload SOURCE=<name> PATH=<file_or_dir>` | Uploads local files or directories to an upload-type source. |
| `make purge` | Purges the database of indexed chunks for a source. |
| `make refresh` | Purges then immediately recrawls a source. |
| `make stop` | Stops an active sync. |
| `make reindex` | Re-embeds the entire corpus (e.g. after changing models). |
| `make test-db-up` | Brings up the testing database. |
| `make test-db-down` | Tears down the testing database. |
| `make test-db-reset` | Resets the testing database to a fresh state. |

> [!WARNING]
> Backup and restore are available via `make backup`, `make backup-prune`, and
> `make restore FILE=backups/docs_<timestamp>.dump` — see the
> [Runbook](docs/runbook.md) for the full procedure. Note that `make purge` or restoring a database without `pg_dump` backup will permanently lose any **uploaded** documents unless you have the original files.
