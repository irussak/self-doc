"""Hybrid (vector + full-text) retrieval over the doc_chunks/doc_pages/doc_sources
schema owned by T1, plus formatting helpers used by the MCP tools in server.py.

Retrieval strategy: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60) over two arms, each capped
at the top 30 candidates:
  - vector arm:  cosine distance (`<=>`) over the HNSW index on doc_chunks.embedding
  - fts arm:     ts_rank over the generated `fts` tsvector column, filtered by
                 `websearch_to_tsquery('english', query)`

Both arms are computed in a single SQL statement (two nested CTEs each, so the
window-based rank is computed only over the already-LIMIT-30 candidate set,
letting the planner use the HNSW/GIN indexes for the expensive part instead of
ranking the whole table).

    is OMITTED (not supplied as an argument, i.e. left at its `None`
    default) is derived from `base_url`, independent of whether the other
    two were supplied: a unique `^[a-z0-9-]+$` slug when `name` is omitted
    (see `source_defaults.derive_name`, made unique against every existing
    `doc_sources.name` regardless of status, via one extra `SELECT` only
    run in that case), and/or scoped `include_prefixes`/a `DEFAULT_MAX_PAGES`
    ceiling when those are omitted (`source_defaults.apply_creation_defaults`).
    This derivation is what makes an under-specified proposal safe: an empty
    `include_prefixes` allows the ENTIRE host and a `None` `max_pages` means
    no page ceiling at all (see `source_defaults` module docstring) —
    leaving only same-host as a bound would let a proposal on a shared docs
    host crawl an entire unrelated product's documentation, whether or not
    a `name` was supplied.

    `max_pages` has no supported "unlimited" opt-out: because its default is
    `None`, an explicit `max_pages=None` is indistinguishable from omitting
    the argument, so BOTH always receive the derived `DEFAULT_MAX_PAGES`
    ceiling. To propose an uncapped crawl, pass an explicit positive
    `max_pages` large enough for your use case — there is no way to request
    a literal `None`/no-ceiling `max_pages` through this function.

    Raises `ProposalError` (never a raw exception) on:
      - invalid configuration (bad name/URL/max_pages/rate_limit_rps, the
        BFS-seed prefix-filter check, or an unknown field), or
      - a duplicate `name` (UNIQUE violation), regardless of the existing
        row's status — a name pending, active, or rejected is still taken.

    There is no `status` parameter: the INSERT's `status` column is a fixed
    SQL literal (see `PROPOSE_SOURCE_SQL`), so no argument combination can
    make this function write anything but 'pending'.

#   - chunking: `_chunk_upload_content` is a simplified sibling of
#     ingestion/app/chunker.py's heading-aware, tokenizer-windowed chunker —
#     same heading-breadcrumb idea, but windowed by a character budget
#     instead of an actual BGE token count (no code-fence-aware unit
#     splitting, no overlap), so this file does not need a hard dependency on
#     `tokenizers`/downloading a tokenizer.json for a feature whose expected
#     input (an agent-pasted note, capped at 1 MB) is short-form text rather
#     than a full crawled page.
#   - embedding: `_embed_passage` reuses the SAME `get_embedding_model()` /
#     `_format_vector_literal` primitives `_embed_query` already uses for
#     search, just on the passage side (PASSAGE_PROMPT instead of
#     QUERY_PROMPT) — this is the asymmetric counterpart already established
#     in this file, adapted rather than reinvented.
#   - insert: `upload_text` replicates `ingestion/app/store.py`'s
#     `replace_page`'s exact DELETE-then-INSERT shape and its
#     `hash_markdown`-style SHA-256 `content_hash` convention (delete any

        no partial processing.

    is `title` slugified via `app.source_defaults._slugify` (the same
    slugify helper `derive_name` already uses elsewhere in this file) —
    re-uploading under the same `title` therefore replaces the same page
    (DELETE-then-INSERT, matching `ingestion/app/store.py`'s `replace_page`
    shape) rather than accumulating duplicates.
